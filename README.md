# MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems Labs - Personal Study

This repository contains my personal implementation of Labs 2-5 from the MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems course (Spring 2024). This is not an official course repository, but a self-study project to improve my skills and understanding of distributed systems concepts.

## Course Reference

- Course: MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems
- Website: http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2024/index.html

## Labs Covered

- Lab 2: Raft
- Lab 3: Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service
- Lab 4: Sharded Key/Value Service
- Lab 5: Concurrent Shared Key/Value Service

## Purpose

This project is for personal learning and skill development. It is not affiliated with MIT or the course staff.

## Structure

The initial commit contains the boilerplate code for the labs. Subsequent commits will show my progress through each lab implementation.

## Disclaimer

This is not a solution repository. It represents my personal work and understanding of the concepts as I progress through the labs.
